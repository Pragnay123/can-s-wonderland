    Leviathan
Are you looking for the ultimate adventure?

For ambitious thrill-seekers looking to conquer Canada’s tallest and fastest roller coaster, look no further! Leviathan, a mystical sea creature, will take you on the ride of your life.

On this record-breaking giga coaster, riders will ascend a heart-pounding 306 feet to make their way to the highest peak in the park, where they’ll be face-to-face with a steep 80 degree drop. Before they know it, they’ll be racing down the track at incredible speeds reaching up to 148 kilometers an hour – fun fact: that’s faster than most trains travel in Canada!

At 306 feet (93.27M) this is the tallest ride in the Park – towering 76 feet (23.2M) taller than Behemoth, and 5 feet (1.52M) taller than WindSeeker.

If you’re looking for fun and adventure, be sure to hit up Leviathan, hold onto your lap bar, and enjoy the wild ride!

This is one of the many great rides in the FAST LANE PLUS lineup. Leviathan is also one of the great FunPix locations where you can show your FunPix card after the ride to collect your on-ride photo.

Guests must be between 54" and 80" tall to ride.

    Behemoth
Can you conquer this monstrous creature?

Deep within the valley lies a mythical creature with enormous strength, which no man can begin to control. Those brave enough will set out on a quest to conquer Behemoth – which as its name indicates – is an extremely large and powerful being. And as the second-largest roller coaster in Canada (second only to Canada's Wonderland's Leviathan), this is no easy feat.

With no upper-body restraints, this monstrous creature will have you clinging to the edge of your seat as it takes you up 230 feet. Your anticipation will build, and your heart will race while you try to take in some of the breathtaking views of its surrounding area (including the 20-acre water park). Once you reach the peak, this adrenaline-pumping beast will send you speeding down at a 75-degree angle of descent with speeds reaching 125 kilometers per hour in just 3.9 seconds! Do you think you can control this creature? There's only one way to find out.

This is one of the many great rides in the FAST LANE PLUS lineup. Behemoth is also one of the great FunPix locations where you can show your FunPix card after the ride to collect your on-ride photo. FunPix is available as a single day digital photo pass or can be added to your Season Pass for an all-season digital photo pass for one low price.

Guests must be between 54" and 80" tall to ride.

     Enjoy the thrills of a rollercoaster while experiencing the sensation of flying. As Canada's Wonderland's only flying coaster, Time Warp offers guests a unique riding experience. Riders are loaded into 4-person cars that rotate to face the ground.

They then travel head first through a spiral lift that provides them with a 360-degree view, a number of inversions, and banked turns, all in lay-down passenger vehicles. This is one of the many great rides in the FAST LANE lineup.

Canada’s first flying coaster opened in 2004.
Sits on the former site of Great Whale of China, which was relocated to Carowinds Amusement Park in North Carolina.
Formerly known as Tomb Raider, under Paramount's operation.
Guests must be 54" tall to ride.
